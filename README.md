# Modernize
Technical assessment

<h2>Project Description</h2>
This project is a page containing a form with validation and an ad. The form collects user information such as name,city,state, email, and phone number. It includes validation to ensure that the user enters the correct format for each field. The ad section displays a short message that encourages the user to take action. The goal of this technical assessment is to create a functional and visually appealing page.

It took approximately 5hrs to complete the project.

<h2>What took the most time and/or what was tricky?</h2>
Ensuring that the form validation worked and that it would work seamlessly on all devices was what took the most time.

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
I am proud of the final product and believe that it meets the goals and requirements of the technical assessment.
